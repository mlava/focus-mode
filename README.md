Turn on focus mode to get real work done.

This extension hides the sidebars, topbar, linked references and more to allow you to focus only on the note you're working on.

Turn on focus mode by opening Command Palette (CTRL-P) and choose Toggle Focus Mode. Turn off by choosing Toggle Focus Mode a second time.

You can also trigger the Toggle Focus Mode command using a keyboard short: ```shift-alt-f```

You can even configure which items to hide and which to keep, using the Roam Depot configuration menu.

### Note regarding search:
In order to maintain access to the Roam Research search menu and keyboard shortcut (CTRL-u) you can turn on 'Keep search intact' in the Roam Depot settings menu for Focus Mode. With this switch turned off the search box and keyboard shortcut will be unavailable (which might be your preference).

If you wish to keep access to search but hide the search box until it is needed, consider applying Alex Rank's center search in your roam/css.

```@import url(https://rcvd.github.io/roam-css-system/modules/centered-search.css);```

This will hide the searchbox but a modal searchbox will appear upon clicking CTRL-u.
