Turn on focus mode to get real work done.

This extension hides the sidebars, topbar, linked references and more to allow you to focus only on the note you're working on.

Turn on focus mode by opening Command Palette (CTRL-P) and choose Toggle Focus Mode. Turn off by choosing Toggle Focus Mode a second time.

You can even configure which items to hide and which to keep, using the Roam Depot configuration menu.
